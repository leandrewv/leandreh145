          <h2>Backed by experience and a long heritage</h2>
          <p>The H125 is a member of Airbus’ rugged and proven Ecureuil family. Over 7,000 members of the Ecureuil family (AS350, AS355, AS550, AS555, H125, H125M, EC130, H130) have been delivered in 133 countries to more than 2,500 operators. Together, these rotorcraft have accumulated 38 million flight hours. The H125 continues as the undisputed leader in its class for 30 years.</p>
          <p>Some 4,100 rotorcraft in this series currently are in service worldwide (of which more than 1,300 are the H125/AS350 B3e versions), and they primarily are used for high-performance missions in high and hot conditions.</p>
          <p>The H125-series helicopters have broken world records throughout their career. In 2005, the AS350 B3 set the world record for the highest-altitude landing and takeoff, performed on Mount Everest at 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) – a title still held today. In May 2013, the AS350 B3 performed the world's highest long-line rescue operation on Lhotse, the world's fourth-highest mountain, located in the Himalayas at 7,800 metres (25,590 feet).</p>

            <h2>Making the best even better</h2>
            <p>The H125 is equipped with a Safran Helicopter Engines' Arriel 2D turboshaft engine with a dual-channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC) unit, plus a third independent and automatic backup channel and an automatic engine startup. The Arriel 2D is fitted with an engine data recorder.</p>
            <h2>A multi-mission workhorse</h2>
            <p>With built-in manoeuvrability, excellent visibility and low vibration levels in the cabin, the H125 has earned its reputation as a true multi-mission workhorse – becoming a common sight at heliports, hospital landing pads, police department operations centres and airports around the world.</p>
            <p>In addition to hundreds of optional equipment choices and supplemental type certificates (STCs), the H125’s cabin has a flat floor that can be quickly and easily reconfigured for various missions, including aerial work, firefighting, law enforcement, rescue, air ambulance, passenger transport, and many others.</p>

    <h2>Safe and intuitive</h2>
    <p>The H125 provides enhanced safety and reduced workload for pilots with its touchscreen glass cockpit instrument panel, which incorporates the Garmin G500H TXi avionics suite and Vehicle &amp; Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) developed for Airbus. The VEMD enables pilots to monitor the main vehicle and engine parameters at a glance. The helicopter’s wireless connection automatically transfers flight data at the end of each flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition, the baseline H125 is now equipped with a crash-resistant fuel system fully compliant with Part&nbsp;27.952 crashworthiness guidelines for swing load operations.</p>
    <h2>Supported by Airbus’ global network</h2>
    <p>Wherever customers operate, a member of Airbus’ worldwide service network is nearby to provide the support needed to keep their H125s flying.</p>
    <p>This network includes 30 customer centres and affiliate sites; along more than 100 distributors, representatives, training centres, repair and maintenance centres, as well as 10 logistics hubs in France, Germany, the United States, Hong Kong and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Airbus is at the customers’ service – from technical support, component repair and overhaul to spare parts support, technical publications, and training.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Germany’s Defence Ministry wants to buy 82 H-145M military helicopters and convert some of them into combat helicopters to replace its Tiger attack helicopter fleet. The Airbus Helicopters H145M is a twin-engine light utility helicopter developed and manufactured by Airbus Helicopters. The news agency Reuters reported that the Germany Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) which has been reluctant to buy into an upgrade of Airbus’s Tiger attack helicopter due to operational problems, wants to buy the 82 aircraft for 3.05 billion euros ($3.3 billion) and arm 24 of them with anti-tank missiles. Germany last year shifted its defence policy after Russia invaded Ukraine, committing 100 billion euros ($107 billion) to modernize the Germany Armed Forces.</p>
